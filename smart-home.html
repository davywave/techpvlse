            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Smart home technology has rapidly evolved over the last decade, becoming an integral part of modern living. From voice-activated lights to AI-driven home security systems, these innovations are redefining comfort, efficiency, and security. In 2025, smart home technology is expected to take another massive leap forward, integrating advanced AI, seamless connectivity, and eco-friendly solutions to create smarter and more intuitive living environments.
            </p>
            
            <h2>The Evolution of Smart Home Technology</h2>
            <p>
                Smart home technology started with basic programmable devices such as thermostats and automated lighting systems. Over time, it evolved into integrated ecosystems where devices communicate with each other through centralized hubs like Amazon Echo or Google Home. The advent of IoT (Internet of Things) played a significant role, enabling every device—from refrigerators to curtains—to become interconnected.
